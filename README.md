# Inverted pendulum

The inverted_pendulum.py program is used to maintain a pendulum in an upright position between -5<sup>o</sup> and 5<sup>o</sup> using a PID controller, with a unit impulse applied at t = 0.<br>
Upon running the program, a graph shows trajectory of the angle of pendulum.<br>

The forced_response.py program plots a graph of the trajectory of the system upon a force sin(100t<sup>2</sup>) being applied at rest, with the $\theta$(t) and x(t) trajectories being plotted on a graph.<br>
Code can be edited to show either trajectory (or both) by commenting out unwanted lines.
